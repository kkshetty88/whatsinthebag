    <h3>
        Basic Game Rules
    </h3>
    <p>
        &bull; This game consists of two teams, mainly Team A and Team B.<br>
        &bull; We begin the game with 40 random words and use these words for 3 rounds.<br>
        &bull; The main idea behind the game is for your team members to guess more words than the other team.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>
        Round 1
    </h3>
        &bull; The game begins with Round 1 where the host (from Team A) sees the first word and tries to describe the word to his team using a sentence/synonym/antonym etc.<br>
        For eg. Lets say the word is "snowflake", you could say "Frozen ice that falls from the sky". You cannot say the word snow in your clue.<br>
        &bull; If your team member guesses it correctly you mark the "Correct" button. If not, you could either "Pass" or keep giving more clues.<br>
        &bull; If its guessed correctly your team earns 1 point and you move on to the next word and so on. You will get 1 minute to describe as many words as possible.<br>
        &bull; Once the time's up, the player from Team B, continues the game by hitting the "Resume" button on his/her screen. <br>
        &bull; This is continued till all the 40 words are over. Once complete we move to Round 2.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Round 2
    </h3>
    <p>
        &bull; We use the same set of 40 words but use a one word clue. The next player in line gets to start this round. <br>
        For eg. Lets say the word is "snowflake" again, you could say "Ice". If all the players had noted snowflake from the previous round, they can guess it correctly.<br>
        &bull; If your team member guesses it correctly you mark the "Correct" button. If not, you could "Pass" or wait till the time's up<br>
        &bull; If its guessed correctly your team earns 1 point and you move on to the next word and so on. You will get 1 minute to give one word clues to as many words as possible.<br>
        &bull; Once the time's up, the next player in line continues the game by hitting the "Resume" button on his/her screen. <br>
        &bull; This is continued till all the 40 words are over. Once complete we move to Round 3.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Round 3
    </h3>
    <p>
        &bull; We use the same set of 40 words but use dumb charades. <br>
        &bull; If your team member guesses it correctly you mark the "Correct" button. If not, you could "Pass" or wait till the time's up<br>
        &bull; If its guessed correctly your team earns 1 point and you move on to the next word and so on. You will get 1 minute to act out as many words as possible.<br>
        &bull; Once the time's up, the next player in line continues the game by hitting the "Resume" button on his/her screen. <br>
        &bull; This is continued till all the 40 words are over. Once complete, the Winner is declared.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Pass
    </h3>
    <p>
        &bull; Each player gets one word he can pass/skip in every turn.<br>
        &bull; The passed word is reshuffled back in the deck.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Switch Next Turn
    </h3>
    <p>
        &bull; This button should be used only in scenarios where Team A gets advantage over Team B and we would want the next round to be started by Team B instead.
